Text Classification

Overview
This repository contains all the necessary tools and pipelines to build a Hate Speech Text Classification model using advanced NLP techniques. This project aims to accurately identify and classify text samples that may contain hate speech, which is crucial for moderating and filtering content in social media platforms, forums, and other communication channels.

Usage

Data Preprocessing
To preprocess the data, run:
bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py

Training the Model
To train the model, execute:
bash
Copy code

Making Predictions
To predict using a pre-trained model, run:
bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py

Technologies
•	Python 3.8+: Primary programming language used.
•	TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the neural network models.
•	Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computation.
•	Scikit-Learn: For additional modeling and metrics.
•	Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and visual representation.

Features
•	Detailed data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure quality input for modeling.
•	Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for text classification.
•	Techniques such as word embedding and tokenization to handle textual data.
•	Model evaluation and prediction scripts for easy assessment.
